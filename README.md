# Airshow Calendar

Welcome to the **Airshow Calendar** project! This is a personal passion project. The project aims to provide a comprehensive and dynamic calendar of airshows, primarily focusing on events in the United Kingdom.

## Project Overview

The Airshow Calendar project consists of:

- **HTML/CSS/JS Interface**: The frontend is a simple, responsive web interface that displays upcoming airshows in a tabular format. The data is dynamically loaded and rendered using JavaScript.
- **JSON Data Source**: The airshow events are stored in a `JSON` file, which includes details such as date, event name, location, and country.
- **Interactive Features**: The calendar highlights today's events and provides a visually appealing presentation using custom styles and animations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Loading**: The airshow data is fetched from a `JSON` file and displayed on the webpage.
- **Today's Events Highlight**: Events occurring on the current date are highlighted with a special style.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes.
